The largest of the four stations is situated 30 km from the mine at the confluence of the Nzoro and Kibali rivers. There are three smaller stations on the Kibali river. The 22 MVA station is a runoff river scheme, which requires the intake of the river through a 4.5 km canal, feeding two penstock lines 3.5 m in diameter and 1.2 km in length. The hydroelectric power will be augmented by a backup power system during the dry season and for the start-up of high dynamic demand systems, like the mill installation. The backup system comprises 30 diesel generators, each with a capacity of 1.5 MVA, which were supplied and installed by generator producer APS, with the support services engineered by DRA. The main fuel farm, with a capacity of 2 600 m3, will supply the generator farm and service the mining operations and vehicle fleet. Two additional fuel farms, each with a 1 200 m3 storage capacity will be built to service the opencast and underground mining sections.

In March, 2006, QMM offered to install an additional generator with capacity to meet the electrical energy needs for Fort Dauphin for at least a decade. The offer included meeting the costs of purchase, installation and maintenance of the generator. The energy would be sold to JIRAMA, the energy utility and collector of tariffs.
The generator was purchased and installed, but JIRAMA and QMM have thus far been unable to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution on the purchase of fuel to feed the generator. Efforts were made to obtain a payment guarantee from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank, but progress was halted by the political crisis. Following this, JIRAMA elected to purchase and install its own generator, but it is apparently defective. The result is that the mining site and port are illuminated every night while Fort Dauphin suffers repeated electricity cuts and often sits in darkness.

62. The view of QMM is that it has done everything reasonably possible for electrical supply to Fort Dauphin. It met the costs of the purchase and installation of the required generator; it offered to sell fuel at a tariff rate that would permit JIRAMA to convert its operating deficit into a profit and worked to obtain a MIGA guarantee. It is now trapped in a dilemma. On the one hand is the need for sound business. On the other hand, QMM runs a high risk of being blamed for the darkness in Fort Dauphin.
