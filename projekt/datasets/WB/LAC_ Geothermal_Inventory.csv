Analysis of chemical and isotopic data from sampled gas and water were used to estimate the areas geothermal potential and recommend new sites for exploration drilling. The distribution of thermal features indicates that deep reservoir fluid rise convectively near the axis of the volcanism and is structurally controlled by north trending faults. An updated conceptual model illustrates the reservoir is recharged locally and fluids are heated to reservoir temperatures near the axis of Quaternary andesitic vents forming the east-west trending dome and flow complex (Goff et al. 1991). Two convective sub systems and lateral outflows make up the overall reservoir with temperatures of 210°C for the northern system and 170°C for the southern system. The study suggested that future drilling should be done closer to the intersections of the north trending faults and the Quaternary volcanic axis.,"1, 2, 17, 52, 53",http://www.inde.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=52&limitstart=1

Present knowledge indicates that the geothermal reservoir is of small size with limited fluid recharge (Lopez et al, 1995). Due to the location of the field in an ecological preserve, CFE has decided that 5 MWe condensing units are appropriate. A binary cycle would also be possible but only if it uses steam (CFE) has already bought small capacity plants to use the separated water ). The estimated useful life of the resource is 25 years. Las Tres Virgenes will supply electricity to the small, isolated Santa Rosalia grid where the maximum present demand is 6 MWe supplied by diesel generators at high cost. A large increase in demand is expected. The approximate cost of 5 MWe plant with two wells including exploration is $13 million or 4 c US/kWh (Le Best, 1997). ","2, 19",

According to CFE (June 2012), the site could use funds for further exploring the resource, which holds significant additional and untapped potential; and there are no insurmountable problems from the forest that in part covers the site (not a protected area, according to CFE). The field has ten plants with an installed capacity of 88 MW--seven 5 -MW backpressure unites, one 50 - MW condensing unit, and two 1.5-MW binary units. Of the total, 63 Mw are located in the field's southern zone (Tejamaniles), 25 in the northern (Marítaro). An average of 19 wells (out of a total of 67) were in production in 1997, all operated by CFE. Average annual flow rate was 830 t/h. Los Azufres' capacity factor is 93.6%. The development strategy is to install condensing units on sites where there is more knowledge of the reservoir and move the backpressure units to sites where more information is needed. CFE is increasing the generation capacity of the field to 188 MW with the installation of four 25 MW condensing units under the Los Azufres II project (El Chino I and II). An additional 100 MW at Los Azufres III and 50 MW at Los Azufres IV are also under assessment. According to CFE, recent mathematical studies concluded that the water table has a potential of 470 MW --350 in the northern sector and 120 in the southern. Volumetric assessments of the resource indicate that Tejamaniles sector can sustain an energy production capacity of 230 MW and the Marítano sector a capacity of 480 MW(Taboada, 1998). Environmental effects due to geothermal production were observed. Leaking evaporation ponds, discharging pipelines and overflowing reinjection wells represent the principal contamination sources in Los Azufres (Birkle and Merkel, 1998). In additional, Los Azufres has been the site of the Geothermal Training Center since 1995 where CFE trains personnel from throughout Latin America in geothermal exploration, engineering, operations, small scale plants (10 - 400 kW), and small-scale uses. CFE is pursuing the development of several direct use projects at Los Azufres including, in priority, wood drying, fruit dehydration, and aquaculture. ","2, 19",

RAM's access to the Casita Project site is dependent upon proving the viability of the resource, and the Company is continuing work under its 24 month overall development plan for the Casita Project in 2012.  In October 2011, the Company obtained approval from MEM to extend the deadline ten months to January 6, 2013, and the Company is in the process of formalizing the extension. Under the development plan required by the Casita Project Exploration Concession, two deep exploration wells were planned to be drilled into a large low-resistivity anomaly detected using the magnetotelluric geophysical exploration method.  The location of the exploration wells was further refined by an aeromagnetic survey of the concession area.  In July 2011, the Company commenced drilling of its first slim hole at the Casita Project, which was drilled to a depth of 842 meters with a total loss of circulation.  A temperature survey conducted in the well has indicated temperature readings exceeding 230°C (446°F). The temperature results obtained and the permeability found indicate that the location has the characteristics of a commercial resource.  As a result of the first slim hole testing, the Company plans to approach MEM to obtain an exploitation license for the Casita Project without drilling any further exploration wells and without making the full investment required by the Casita Project Exploration Concession.","1, 2, 7, 17, 22, 23, 44","http://thinkgeoenergy.com/archives/10163
